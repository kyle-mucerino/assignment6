          Visitors to the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum will now encounter a deeply significant
          artifact in the effort to tell the full story of Emmett Till: the gun used in his 1955 murder.
          Announced during a recent press conference at the Two Mississippi Museums campus in Jackson,
          the addition expands an exhibit that confronts one of the most pivotal moments in U.S. civil rights history.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dr. Rafael Matos, curator at the Two Mississippi Museums, said the firearm was authenticated
          through its serial number, which matches records tied to the weapon used in Till’s death.
          Its inclusion is not intended to sensationalize violence, Matos explained, but to complete the historical
          narrative.
          While the widely published images of Till’s brutalized body — shared at the insistence of his mother,
          Mamie Till-Mobley — helped galvanize the movement, museum officials say adding the weapon acknowledges
          the full reality of the crime and the systems that allowed it.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Mississippi Civil Rights Museum documents the era from 1945 to 1975, when the state was considered
          ground zero for the national movement. In 1955, the 14-year-old Chicago native was abducted, tortured
          and murdered while visiting family in Mississippi after being accused of offending a white woman.
          The acquittal of the men charged sparked national outrage and became a catalyst for activism.
        </p>

        <p>
          Museum leaders emphasized that displaying the artifact signals a commitment to truth and justice.
          Though no additional individuals have been held accountable, officials hope the exhibit shows
          the story is still examined with care.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Till family was informed prior to the display, with Till's cousin, Wheeler Parker Jr.,
          serving as the primary contact. Parker expressed gratitude that the item would be presented thoughtfully.
          To allow for reflection, the gun is displayed separately from other exhibit elements.
        </p>

        <p>
          Museum officials believe Mississippi is the appropriate home for the artifact because the crime occurred
          there.
          By presenting it where the history unfolded, the exhibit asks visitors to confront the history
          that shaped a movement — and continues to shape the present.
